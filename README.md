This app is our team's submission to the ELC Accessible Beauty Hackathon. Our goal was to ideate and develop an inclusive technology solution that enhances accessibility in the beauty industry and improves the consumer's beauty experience.

## App Description

Our team built an app that allows users to try, search for, and share their experiences with beauty products. The app provides valuable feedback and information about beauty and care products ranked for accessibility. Users can also view products in 3D.

We considered using AR for makeup try-ons and Whisper AI for an accessible search experience. For this project, we utilized a variety of technologies to build a robust and dynamic platform. We used the React Native framework for our front-end development, GraphQL API for our back-end, Firebase MongoDB for our database and authentication, and Victory for data visualization.

In addition to these technologies, we had planned to work with ChatGPT, WhisperAI, UPC scanner, AR, text to image, Lens Studio, and Unity to further enhance the app's capabilities and user experience.

However, we faced some difficulties due to time constraints and getting approvals for using APIs from companies such as Amazon and SnapChat. The lengthy process of obtaining permission hindered our ability to demonstrate the full potential of the app.

We are proud of what we have achieved with this app and hope it helps to enhance accessibility in the beauty industry.
